title = Clamp-O-Tron Shielded Docking Port

description = Invented after a peaceful protest against the lack of spacecraft attachment systems turned violent, the Clamp-O-Tron Docking Port allows for the firm attachment of two separate vessels. After docking, vessels can be just as easily undocked. The Shielded version has deployable fins to protect the port during ascent.
