title = PB-ION Electric Propulsion System
manufacturer = Ionic Protonic Electronics
description = By emitting ionized xenon gas through a small thruster port, the PB-ION can produce incredibly efficient propulsion, but with a downside of very low thrust and high expense. The general perception of this engine as being powered by "witchcraft" has unfortunately given it a sour reputation.
